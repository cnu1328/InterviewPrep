Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.


```bash

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

```

When you enter the commands `npx create-react-app my-app`, `cd my-app`, and `npm start` in your bash terminal, here's what happens step by step:

### Step 1: `npx create-react-app my-app`

- **Command**: `npx create-react-app my-app`
- **What happens**:
  1. **npx**: `npx` is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2.0 and higher. It allows you to run packages without having to install them globally.
  2. **create-react-app**: This is a command-line tool provided by Facebook to quickly set up a new React application with a sensible default configuration.
  3. **my-app**: This is the name of the directory where your new React application will be created.

- **Process**:
  1. **Downloads and runs create-react-app**: `npx` downloads the `create-react-app` package (if it is not already installed) and runs it.
  2. **Project creation**: The tool creates a new directory named `my-app` and sets up a new React application inside it.
  3. **Installs dependencies**: It installs all the necessary dependencies and sets up the initial project structure, including essential files and folders such as `src`, `public`, `node_modules`, `package.json`, etc.
  4. **Initial setup**: It configures the project with a default setup, including a default `App` component, basic styling, and a service worker.

- **Output**: A new directory named `my-app` is created with a basic React application setup.

### Step 2: `cd my-app`

- **Command**: `cd my-app`
- **What happens**:
  1. **cd**: This command stands for "change directory".
  2. **my-app**: This is the name of the directory you want to move into.

- **Process**:
  1. The terminal changes its current working directory to `my-app`, the directory where your new React application was created.

- **Output**: You are now inside the `my-app` directory and can run commands related to your React project.

### Step 3: `npm start`

- **Command**: `npm start`
- **What happens**:
  1. **npm**: Node Package Manager, used to manage JavaScript packages.
  2. **start**: This is a script defined in the `package.json` file of your React project.

- **Process**:
  1. **Reads package.json**: `npm` reads the `package.json` file to find the `start` script. In a Create React App project, this script is usually `"start": "react-scripts start"`.
  2. **Runs start script**: `npm` runs `react-scripts start`, which does the following:
     - **Compiles the application**: It compiles the React application in development mode.
     - **Starts development server**: It starts a development server using `webpack-dev-server`.
     - **Opens the browser**: By default, it opens your default web browser and navigates to `http://localhost:3000`, where your React application is running.

- **Output**:
  1. The terminal displays the progress of the compilation and any potential warnings or errors.
  2. Once the development server is running, you will see a message indicating that the application is running at `http://localhost:3000`.
  3. The default web browser opens and displays the default React application with a "React App" page.

### Summary
- **`npx create-react-app my-app`**: Creates a new React application in the `my-app` directory.
- **`cd my-app`**: Changes the current directory to `my-app`.
- **`npm start`**: Starts the development server, compiles the application, and opens it in the web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
