## Exercise Feature

The exercise feature allows trainers to add new exercises to the app's database with comprehensive details. This feature is crucial for the following reasons:

1. **Personalization**: Trainers can customize workout programs to suit individual client needs by creating specific exercises targeting different focus areas and categories.

2. **Efficiency**: By tagging exercises with relevant keywords, trainers and clients can easily search and filter exercises, saving time and enhancing the user experience.

3. **Clarity**: Providing detailed descriptions and media links ensures that clients understand how to perform each exercise correctly, reducing the risk of injury and improving workout effectiveness.

4. **Consistency**: Standardizing exercise details helps maintain consistency across different trainers and programs within the app, ensuring a cohesive training experience for all clients.

This feature enriches the Shapefitio platform by enabling trainers to offer more varied and tailored workout programs, ultimately enhancing client satisfaction and fitness outcomes.
