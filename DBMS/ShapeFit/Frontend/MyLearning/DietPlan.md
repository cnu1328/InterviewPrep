## DietPlan Feature

### Overview

This feature helps trainers create a diet plan with the required amounts of calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. To create a DietPlan, it uses the food items created beforehand.

### Steps to Create a DietPlan

1. **Provide DietPlan Details**

   - The trainer needs to give the diet plan a name and specify the target amounts for calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

2. **Create Meals for the DietPlan**

   - The trainer creates different meals for the diet plan, such as Breakfast, Lunch, Pre Workout, Post Workout, Snacks, and Dinner.

3. **Select Food Items for Each Meal**
   - For each meal, the trainer selects food items. Below are examples of food items:

| Food Item | Calories (per 100g) | Proteins (per 100g) | Carbohydrates (per 100g) | Fats (per 100g) |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| Rice      | 130                 | 2.4                 | 28                       | 0.3             |
| Chicken   | 165                 | 31                  | 0                        | 3.6             |

4. **Search and Select Food Items**

   - Trainers can search for food items and select the required ones. When a food item is selected, all fields (calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) are automatically filled according to the values of the food item.

5. **Adjust Portion Sizes**

   - Trainers can change the portion (quantity) of the food item, which will affect the amount of calories, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.

6. **View Total Nutrients**

   - Trainers can see the total amounts of calories, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats for each meal.
   - The UI also displays the total amounts for all meals combined.
   - It shows the remaining amounts of calories, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats needed to reach the target or if the target has been exceeded.

7. **Validation**
   - Added validations ensure that the user must pass all checks to create a diet plan.
