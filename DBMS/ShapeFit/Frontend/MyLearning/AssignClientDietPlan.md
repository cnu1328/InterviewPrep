### Use of Client DietPlans Feature

The Client DietPlans feature helps trainers manage their clients' diet plans effectively. Hereâ€™s how it helps:

1. **Organization**: Trainers can easily assign, modify, and delete diet plans for their clients, keeping their plans organized.
2. **Flexibility**: The ability to select start and end dates for diet plans allows trainers to customize the duration for each client.
