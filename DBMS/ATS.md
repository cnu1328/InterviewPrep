Do you think that an actual person sits down and looks through every resume that gets submitted?

No right!. I will share my experience, that, I applied to many jobs with the same resume. I felt my that my resume is optimized, but I realised that, it is not enough to shorlist my resume. Then I started researching about how the application process will go on, and how a recruiter will judge our resume and how our resume will be shortlisted.

I read blogs on it and I saw youtube videos, then I found that, our resumes will parsed and judged by an ATS(applicant tracking system) before a actual human reads. let's explore about ATS. 


# What is an applicant tracking system?

ATS is a software that parses, or scrapes, your resume and helps recruiters and hiring managers to organize and manage applicants.

- Stores job candidate information like resumes, cover letters, references, and other data.
- Tracks job candidates and their application status throughout the hiring pipeline.
- Automates time-consuming tasks such as manually screening applicants, reading resumes, scheduling interviews, and sending out notifications.

For job seekers, like us, the most important thing to understand about the ATS is that it enables employers to filter resumes based on **keywords**. The most suitable resumes are then forwarded to the hiring managers for manual review.

This is why it’s crucial that we need to tailor each resume with relevant keywords and use a clear, ATS-friendly format. Doing so will help us application pass through the initial screening and increase our chances that a hiring manager will read our resume – and invite us for an interview.

## How do applicant tracking systems work?

When we submit our application, it usually goes straight into an ATS database. But first we might see some knockout questions.

Knockout questions can be in the style of checkboxes or short answer questions. If we answer any of the knockout questions unsatisfactorily, our resume will either be flagged or automatically rejected by the ATS.

### Some examples of knockout questions

    - Do you have X years of experience?
    - Are you willing to travel as part of this job? 
    - Are you willing to work full-time?
    - Are you willing to relocate?
    - Are you belongs to CSE  stream?

After presenting us with knockout questions, the ATS scans our resume and parses it. This involves sifting through our information and converting it into a structured format.

This information is stored in the ATS tracking database. When recruiters want to find suitable job candidates, all they have to do is search through the database for them.

## How do hiring managers use ATS to find candidates?


Hiring managers use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to efficiently find suitable job candidates by utilizing keywords related to job titles or specific skills. These keywords can be single words or phrases. The ATS scans the resumes in its database and highlights those that match the keywords entered by the hiring manager.

### Example:

Let's say a hiring manager is looking for a full-stack developer. They might start by entering the keyword "full-stack developer" into the ATS search bar.

To refine their search, they can add more specific terms. For instance, they might include "JavaScript," "React," and "Node.js." In this case, resumes that contain all three keywords ("full-stack developer," "JavaScript," and "React") will be displayed to the hiring manager. Resumes lacking any of these terms will not appear in the search results.


This is why it’s crucial to make sure your resume contains keywords related to the job you’re applying to.

If your resume doesn’t contain the right keywords, it will never be reviewed by a human being and you won’t get the job.


## Tailor each resume to the job
To get the best results from your job search, tailor each resume you send out so it specifically targets the job you’re applying for.

This takes more time and effort than just sending out the same resume every time (which is why most people don’t do it), but you’ll get more job interviews.
