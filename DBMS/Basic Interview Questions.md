## 3. Differences between DBMS and RDBMS


| DBMS          |RDBMS                                    | 
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| DBMS stores data as file.     | RDBMS stores data in tabular form.   |
| Data elements need to access individually.    | Multiple data elements can be accessed at the same time.   | 
| No relationship between data.    | Data is stored in the form of tables which are related to each other.   |

## 3. What is a Database?

1. A Database is an organized, consistent, and logical collection of data that can easily be updated, accessed, and managed.

2. Database mostly contains sets of tables or objects (anything created using create command is a database object) which consist of records and fields.

3. A tuple or a row represents a single entry in a table. An attribute or a column represents the basic units of data storage, which contain information about a particular aspect of the table.

4. DBMS extracts data from a database in the form of queries given by the user.
